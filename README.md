## Quickstart

This brief example demonstrates how to upload a signed Helm chart to Rekor and validate the entry

### Upload a Signed Helm Chart

```
$ helm sigstore upload <path_to_packaged_chart>

Created Helm entry at index 6821, available at: https://rekor.sigstore.dev/api/v1/log/entries/b30a142ef6c8b0480cd3e081fc99bc3d2a1a50ef60f68749c983a1479be6c4b9
```

_NOTE_: The provenance file must be located in the same directory as the packaged chart

### Verify the Signed Chart from Rekor

Use the same signed Helm chart from the prior section to verify the entry in Rekor

```shell
helm sigstore verify <path_to_packaged_chart>
Chart Verified Successfully From Helm entry:

Rekor Server: https://rekor.sigstore.dev
Rekor Index: 6821
Rekor UUID: b30a142ef6c8b0480cd3e081fc99bc3d2a1a50ef60f68749c983a1479be6c4b9
```
